$section Changes and Additions to CppAD During 2021$$

$head 01-26$$
Change the prototype for the cmake command
$cref/options/cmake/CMake Command/Options/$$ to use $icode true_or_false$$,
instead of $code true$$ to highlight the fact that one can choose either
true or false.

$head 01-08$$
On some systems, the file $code cppad_lib/json_lexer.cpp$$ would not compile
because the $code std::isdigit$$ function was not defined.
This has been fixed.

$head 01-07$$
The example $cref pow_nan.cpp$$ was added.

$head 01-05$$
$list number$$
Improve discussion of $cref/cppad_cxx/cmake/cppad_cxx_flags/$$
and make sure all uses are exactly as described.
In addition, change mention of optional features from C++11 to C++17.
$lnext
The required version of $cref cmake$$ was advanced from 2.8.4 to 3.0.
This fixes a policy CMP0042 warning on Mac systems.
$lnext
If the compiler, plus the flags in
$cref/cppad_cxx_flags/cmake/cppad_cxx_flags/$$,
does not by default support C++11, cmake is used
to find and add the flags necessary for this support.
$lend

$head 01-03$$
$list number$$
Fix a bug in $cref reverse$$ mode for an
$codei%ADFun< AD<%Base%> >%$$ function that has
$cref/dynamic/Independent/dynamic/$$ parameters and
value of one of these parameters was zero or one when the function
was recorded.
$lnext
Fix a bug in the $cref autotools$$ building of $code cppad_lib$$.
$lend
