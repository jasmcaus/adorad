- Matrix associativity optimization? :)

- Could add transpose and reshape parameters to certain nodes just to reduce uneccessary memory duplication

- Certian nodes can be applied in place automatically or upon request

- Nodes should have a getValue function that returns a reference to some xarray, then maybe some memory optimizations can be done?

- Somehow prevent grad (and recompute() in Module::forward()) from being computed on constant nodes and subgraphs

- Could parallelize computation in the graph probably

- I probably will not do these things though. Too much work for a toy project like this.
  Many more optimizations are described in the theano documentation.
